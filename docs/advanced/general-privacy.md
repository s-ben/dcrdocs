## Trade-offs of reusing vs not reusing addresses

For privacy, the best practice is to not reuse an address ever. A cryptocurrency address can be thought of a cryptocurrency invoice instead. The term "address" does not mean, that it was designed to reuse it, like one would do with a bank account number for example. If someone would really care about privacy he or she would be using newly generated addresses even on a website.
On the other hand, address reuse is preferred in situations when privacy is not important and we don't want to make the mistake of sending over larg amount of funds to a wrong address.
